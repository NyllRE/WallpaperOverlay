<!-- ## Updates

* Better implemented code. -->

## Motivation

I have a habit to change my wallpaper more frequently. And there were some problems I faced on a regular basis:

- I needed to change my dock colour everytime I change my wallpaper so that It may feel consistent with the wallpaper.
- If my dock was transparent then for some wallpapers the color of dock area was so light that the text were barely visible.
- Adding a solid color to dock sometimes gave the feeling that the dock and wallpaper are two separate entities and if I put gradient on the dock then the gradient looked weird as it ranged on the very short heighted dock.
- I made this extension to solve these problems, but while in the making, I realised that It has huge potential. Like I can imagine a huge set of several innovative overlays which make the Linux desktop experience more pleasing.

## Features

This extension has following features:

- Apply an overlay on wallpaper in four easy steps
  - Choose image : Either take the currently set wallpaper or choose it manually through the file picker
  - Choose overlay : Either choose it from the default library or select a custom svg overlay
  - Choose color : Each overlay has one colour that can be modified to the colour you choose here. In the svg file this colour is #0000ff
  - Click apply and the overlay will be applied and wallpaper will be set.
- You can even apply multiple overlays by:
  - Apply one overlay
  - Reselect current set wallpaper
  - Apply second overlay and so on.
- You can create your own svg overlays in inkspace and apply them. Copy any overlay file present in /src/resources/ in this repo and edit it in inkspace to create your own overlay file.
  - Note: The color #0000ff in the overlay file will be replaced by the user selected color.
